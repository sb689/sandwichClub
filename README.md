This project was developed as part of an online course. A started code was provided to complete the application.

## Project Overview
In this project, a complete app **Sandwich Club** will be developed where user can select a sandwitch to
show the details.

## Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help to better understand how it is processed.

## Learning objectives
- Learn how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

### How to Complete this Project?
- Download the starter code.
- Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements display in a sensible way. 
- Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI.
